I get higher than a astronaut
Bentley coupes up in my parking spot
Mansions in the hills we balling out
That's my baby we be cashing out
Pop me a perc and I'm outta space
Young nigga I feel so outta place
Look at the stars it's right in the wraith
Me and my shorty we going great
Me and my chick made a lot of cake
Kiss me and tell me you love me bae
We taking off like a astronaut
We look down on the earth cause you know we stars

I look down on the earth
While I be smoking on herb
Please do not come on my turf
Bitches be cappin'
Ain't talking no money, put bricks in my purse
Man I'm so groovy, texting me how he gon' do me
Bitch I'm to rich for the movies
I get the bag, and I secure it real fast
Put that shit straight in my pants
Aye, come and fuck me
Kiss me like you love me
We got rarri's racing
Bitch my diamonds dancing
We don't never FaceTime
Money so big go to Dubai
We be on another flight

I get higher than a astronaut
Bentley coupes up in my parking spot
Mansions in the hills we balling out
That's my baby we be cashing out
Pop me a perc and I'm outta space
Young nigga I feel so outta place
Look at the stars it's right in the wraith
Me and my shorty we going great
Me and my chick made a lot of cake
Kiss me and tell me you love me bae
We taking off like a astronaut
We look down on the earth cause you know we stars

I am not next lil' nigga I swear I take off everyday
My new bitch badder than yours any day
And you know the difference like mink in the wraith
Me and my shorty just copped a new AP
I just left jeweler that rolly was basic
I flew to Bora Bora for vacation
I took a private jet to Jamaica
You ain't got money, you ain't balling nigga
Me and my bitch we gon' ball with six figures
She was Asian Doll I was like Kian
We gon' lay back, maybach just like the Benz
Took her to Pluto and we got it in
We count the hundreds that shit comes in tens
I ain't got time to hear what she gon' say
I'm like an astronaut, just outta space

I get higher than a astronaut
Bentley coupes up in my parking spot
Mansions in the hills we balling out
That's my baby we be cashing out
Pop me a perc and I'm outta space
Young nigga I feel so outta place
Look at the stars it's right in the wraith
Me and my shorty we going great
Me and my chick made a lot of cake
Kiss me and tell me you love me bae
We taking off like a astronaut
We look down on the earth cause you know we stars

I get high I'm outta space
Bentley coupe, skkrt, skkrt
Mansions in the hills we balling
That my baby he be calling
I get high I'm outta space
Bentley coupe, skkrt, skkrt
Mansions in the hills we balling
That my baby he be calling
Aye, I'm outta space
So outta place
In a wraith, I'm going great
Made 'lotta money, she love me bae
An astronaut!

I get higher than an astronaut
I get higher than an astronaut
I get higher than an astronaut
I get higher than an astronaut
